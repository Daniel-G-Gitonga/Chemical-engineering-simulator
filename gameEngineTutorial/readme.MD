# __*[ROSE ENGINE]*__... 
__how rose works__...
rose is the engine
sandbox is the game that depends on the engine...
when compiled, a ddl file rose.dll rose.dll.a is created and placed in same folder as .exe for sand box
all i can say thanks to cmake...
(ins)__[best_practice_refresh_on_libraries_in_Cpp_we_simplified_everything_by_using_macros]__
engineheaders.h is aheaderfile that contains all headers that we need from the engine 
we will include all headers here then include this header in our sandbox main file.
(__nb__)==> we specified to cmake to look for includes in the rose subfolder
